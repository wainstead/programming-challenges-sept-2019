## Two programming challenges

These are two puzzles I solved recently. The first script uses
recursion and binary search to guess what number you are thinking
of. The second script takes a chess piece and a board position and
prints the possible moves for that piece.

Requires Python 3.x.

### Code Exercise 1

To run the script:

python3 guessnumber.py



### Code Exercise 2

To run the script:

python3 chessercise.py -piece queen -position d2

To run the tests:

python3 test_chessercize.py
